# Simulations for "Network Global Testing: Phase Transitions and Power Enhancement" by Cammarata and Ke (2021)

This repository contains code to replicate the simulation results in Section 4 of the paper. A Jupyter notebook is devoted to each of the four experiments implemented in the paper. The data_gen.py file contains functions to generate synthetic data, the stat_test.py file contains functions to compute test statistics and p-values, and the visualizations.py file contains functions for plotting. Details on the methods used for comparison in Experiment 4 are provided in Appendix.pdf.
